# Jeopardy with Next.js & Strapi ðŸŽ®

## Overview

Welcome to our Jeopardy game! This project is a fun, interactive Jeopardy-style trivia game built with Next.js 13.4 and powered by a Strapi CMS backend. Initially intended as a game for twoâ€”me and my lovely wifeâ€”it serves as a perfect example of how to create a trivia app using modern tech.

- **Local Play**: Designed for a great two-player experience.

## Tech Stack
